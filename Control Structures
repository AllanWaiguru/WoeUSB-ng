The choice of repetition control structure depends on the specific requirements of the program. Here's when it is advisable to use each of the following repetition control structures:

For Loop:

Use a for loop when the number of iterations is known or fixed.
It is suitable for iterating over a range of values or a collection.
The syntax of a for loop typically includes an initialization, a condition for continuation, and an update statement.

While Loop:

Use a while loop when the number of iterations is not known in advance and is based on a condition.
It is suitable for situations where the loop needs to continue until a certain condition is met.
The loop continues as long as the specified condition is true.

Do...While Loop:

Use a do...while loop when you want to execute the loop's body at least once, regardless of the condition.
It is suitable for situations where the loop's body needs to be executed before checking the condition for continuation.
The loop executes the code block first and then checks the condition for further iterations.
